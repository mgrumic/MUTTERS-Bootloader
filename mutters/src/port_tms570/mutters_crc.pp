/*
 * The __CONCAT macro is used to concatenate parts of symbol names, e.g.
 * with "#define OLD(foo) __CONCAT(old,foo)", OLD(foo) produces oldfoo.
 * The __CONCAT macro is a bit tricky to use if it must work in non-ANSI
 * mode -- there must be no spaces between its arguments, and for nested
 * __CONCAT's, all the __CONCAT's must be at the left.  __CONCAT can also
 * concatenate double-quoted strings produced by the __STRING macro, but
 * this only works with ANSI C.
 *
 * __XSTRING is like __STRING, but it expands any macros in its argument
 * first.  It is only available with ANSI C.
 */



/*

 * pure (no side effects) functions, and unused variables.  They are
 * null except for versions of gcc that are known to support the features

 * in a different (wrong) way).  If we do not provide an implementation
 * for a given compiler, let the compile fail if it is told to use
 * a feature that we cannot live without.
 */

/*

 * syntax.  Therefore implement something similar under the name
 * __generic().  Unlike _Generic(), this macro can only distinguish

 * distinguish multiple cases.
 */

 * void bar(int myArray[__min_size(10)]);
 */







/* XXX: should use `#if __STDC_VERSION__ < 199901'. */


/* C++11 exposes a load of C99 stuff */

/*
 * GCC 2.95 provides `__restrict' as an extension to C90 to support the
 * C99-specific `restrict' type qualifier.  We happen to use `__restrict' as
 * a way to define the `restrict' type qualifier without disturbing older
 * software that is unaware of C99 keywords.
 * The TI compiler supports __restrict in all compilation modes.
 */

/*
 * GNU C version 2.96 adds explicit branch prediction so that
 * the CPU back-end can hint the processor and also so that
 * code blocks can be reordered such that the predicted path
 * sees a more linear flow, thus improving cache behavior, etc.
 *
 * The following two macros provide us with a way to utilize this
 * compiler feature.  Use __predict_true() if you expect the expression
 * to evaluate to true, and __predict_false() if you expect the
 * expression to evaluate to false.
 *
 * A few notes about usage:
 *
 *	* Generally, __predict_false() error condition checks (unless
 *	  you have some _strong_ reason to do otherwise, in which case
 *	  document it), and/or __predict_true() `no-error' condition
 *	  checks, assuming you want to optimize for the no-error case.
 *
 *	* Other than that, if you don't know the likelihood of a test
 *	  succeeding from empirical or other `hard' evidence, don't
 *	  make predictions.
 *
 *	* These are meant to be used in places that are run `a lot'.
 *	  It is wasteful to make predictions in code that is run
 *	  seldomly (e.g. at subsystem initialization time) as the
 *	  basic block reordering that this affects can often generate
 *	  larger code.

/*
 * Given the pointer x to the member m of the struct s, return
 * a pointer to the containing structure.  When using GCC, we first
 * assign pointer x to a local variable, to check that its type is
 * compatible with member m.

/*
 * Compiler-dependent macros to declare that functions take printf-like
 * or scanf-like arguments.  They are null except for versions of gcc
 * that are known to support the features properly (old versions of gcc-2
 * didn't permit keeping the keywords out of the application namespace).
 */

/* Compiler-dependent macros that rely on FreeBSD-specific extensions. */



/*
 * The following definition might not work well if used in header files,
 * but it should be better than nothing.  If you want a "do nothing"
 * version, then it should generate some harmless declaration, such as:
 *    #define	__IDSTRING(name,string)	struct __hack

/*-
 * The following definitions are an extension of the behavior originally
 * implemented in <sys/_posix.h>, but with a different level of granularity.
 * POSIX.1 requires that the macros we test be defined before any standard

 *
 * Here's a quick run-down of the versions:
 *  defined(_POSIX_SOURCE)		1003.1-1988
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 1		1003.1-1990
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 2		1003.2-1992 C Language Binding Option
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 199309		1003.1b-1993
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 199506		1003.1c-1995, 1003.1i-1995,
 *					and the omnibus ISO/IEC 9945-1: 1996
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200112		1003.1-2001
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200809		1003.1-2008
 *
 * In addition, the X/Open Portability Guide, which is now the Single UNIX
 * Specification, defines a feature-test macro which indicates the version of
 * that specification, and which subsumes _POSIX_C_SOURCE.
 *
 * Our macros begin with two underscores to avoid namespace screwage.
 */

/* Deal with IEEE Std. 1003.1-1990, in which _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 1. */

/* Deal with IEEE Std. 1003.2-1992, in which _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 2. */

/* Deal with various X/Open Portability Guides and Single UNIX Spec. */

/*
 * Deal with all versions of POSIX.  The ordering relative to the tests above is
 * important.
 */
/*-
 * Deal with _ANSI_SOURCE:
 * If it is defined, and no other compilation environment is explicitly
 * requested, then define our internal feature-test macros to zero.  This
 * makes no difference to the preprocessor (undefined symbols in preprocessing
 * expressions are defined to have value zero), but makes it more convenient for
 * a test program to print out the values.
 *
 * If a program mistakenly defines _ANSI_SOURCE and some other macro such as
 * _POSIX_C_SOURCE, we will assume that it wants the broader compilation
 * environment (and in fact we will never get here).

/* User override __EXT1_VISIBLE */


/*
 * Old versions of GCC use non-standard ARM arch symbols; acle-compat.h
 * translates them to __ARM_ARCH and the modern feature symbols defined by ARM.
 */

/*
 * Nullability qualifiers: currently only supported by Clang.

/*
 * Type Safety Checking
 *
 * Clang provides additional attributes to enable checking type safety
 * properties that cannot be enforced by the C type system.

/*
 * Lock annotations.
 *
 * Clang provides support for doing basic thread-safety tests at
 * compile-time, by marking which locks will/should be held when
 * entering/leaving a functions.
 *
 * Furthermore, it is also possible to annotate variables and structure
 * members to enforce that they are only accessed when certain locks are
 * held.

 * rune_t is declared to be an ``int'' instead of the more natural

 * it looks like 10646 will be a 31 bit standard.  This means that if your
 * ints cannot hold 32 bits, you will be in trouble.  The reason an int was
 * chosen over a long is that the is*() and to*() routines take ints (says
 * ANSI C), but they use __ct_rune_t instead of int.
 *
 * NOTE: rune_t is not covered by ANSI nor other standards, and should not
 * be instantiated outside of lib/libc/locale.  Use wchar_t.  wint_t and
 * rune_t must be the same type.  Also, wint_t should be able to hold all

 *  @brief Cyclic Redundancy Check Controller Module.
 *  
 *  The CRC controller is a module that is used to perform CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) to verify the
 *  integrity of memory system. A signature representing the contents of the memory is obtained when the
 *  contents of the memory are read into CRC controller. The responsibility of CRC controller is to calculate
 *  the signature for a set of data and then compare the calculated signature value against a pre-determined
 *  good signature value. CRC controller supports two channels to perform CRC calculation on multiple
 *  memories in parallel and can be used on any memory system.
