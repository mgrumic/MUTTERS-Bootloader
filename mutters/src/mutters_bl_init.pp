/*
 * The __CONCAT macro is used to concatenate parts of symbol names, e.g.
 * with "#define OLD(foo) __CONCAT(old,foo)", OLD(foo) produces oldfoo.
 * The __CONCAT macro is a bit tricky to use if it must work in non-ANSI
 * mode -- there must be no spaces between its arguments, and for nested
 * __CONCAT's, all the __CONCAT's must be at the left.  __CONCAT can also
 * concatenate double-quoted strings produced by the __STRING macro, but
 * this only works with ANSI C.
 *
 * __XSTRING is like __STRING, but it expands any macros in its argument
 * first.  It is only available with ANSI C.
 */

 * pure (no side effects) functions, and unused variables.  They are
 * null except for versions of gcc that are known to support the features
 * properly (old versions of gcc-2 supported the dead and pure features
 * in a different (wrong) way).  If we do not provide an implementation
 * for a given compiler, let the compile fail if it is told to use
 * a feature that we cannot live without.

 * GCC 2.95 provides `__restrict' as an extension to C90 to support the
 * C99-specific `restrict' type qualifier.  We happen to use `__restrict' as
 * a way to define the `restrict' type qualifier without disturbing older
 * software that is unaware of C99 keywords.
 * The TI compiler supports __restrict in all compilation modes.
 */

/*
 * GNU C version 2.96 adds explicit branch prediction so that
 * the CPU back-end can hint the processor and also so that
 * code blocks can be reordered such that the predicted path
 * sees a more linear flow, thus improving cache behavior, etc.
 *
 * The following two macros provide us with a way to utilize this
 * compiler feature.  Use __predict_true() if you expect the expression
 * to evaluate to true, and __predict_false() if you expect the
 * expression to evaluate to false.
 *
 * A few notes about usage:
 *
 *	* Generally, __predict_false() error condition checks (unless
 *	  you have some _strong_ reason to do otherwise, in which case
 *	  document it), and/or __predict_true() `no-error' condition
 *	  checks, assuming you want to optimize for the no-error case.
 *
 *	* Other than that, if you don't know the likelihood of a test
 *	  succeeding from empirical or other `hard' evidence, don't
 *	  make predictions.
 *
 *	* These are meant to be used in places that are run `a lot'.
 *	  It is wasteful to make predictions in code that is run
 *	  seldomly (e.g. at subsystem initialization time) as the
 *	  basic block reordering that this affects can often generate
 *	  larger code.

 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200112		1003.1-2001
 *  _POSIX_C_SOURCE == 200809		1003.1-2008
 *
 * In addition, the X/Open Portability Guide, which is now the Single UNIX

 * rune_t is declared to be an ``int'' instead of the more natural
 * ``unsigned long'' or ``long''.  Two things are happening here.  It is not
 * unsigned so that EOF (-1) can be naturally assigned to it and used.  Also,
 * it looks like 10646 will be a 31 bit standard.  This means that if your
 * ints cannot hold 32 bits, you will be in trouble.  The reason an int was
 * chosen over a long is that the is*() and to*() routines take ints (says
 * ANSI C), but they use __ct_rune_t instead of int.
 *
 * NOTE: rune_t is not covered by ANSI nor other standards, and should not
 * be instantiated outside of lib/libc/locale.  Use wchar_t.  wint_t and
 * rune_t must be the same type.  Also, wint_t should be able to hold all
 * members of the largest character set plus one extra value (WEOF), and
 * must be at least 16 bits.
